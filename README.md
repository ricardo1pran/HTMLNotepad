# HTMLNotepad

A very basic and simple Notepad using HTML, able to save as TXT.

This is useful if you're using a limited OS but need to take notes in txt, but there's no notepad-like apps available in your OS.

Example cases: Old builds of ChromiumOS, very simple Linux build that could access internet using browser but no gedit or text editors available and don't want (or can't) install apps by yourself (admin managed), or even want to type and produce txt files on mobile phone (Android/iOS) without downloading any text editor apps.

In fact, I made this because my ChromiumOS VM can't even install the Text extension anymore and I can't even take notes.

### Features:

- Simple, 1 HTML file under 200 lines (including CSS and JS), for now

- Responsive enough

- Has menu bar that looks like desktop app's menu bar (not simple buttons)

- Work in most semi-modern to modern browsers

- Could save to a .txt file in any OS and browser

---

### To-Do's:

- Add compatibility with older browsers (for example: IE <=7, Firefox <=48, Chrome <=64, etc) (some browsers like IE limits the size of the textarea even though other CSS works fine, and save function not working)

- Host somewhere (or using github pages) for demo

- Fix some not-so-responsive in some modern browsers (remove the need of scrolling)
